## Installation

First step is to clone the GitHub repository

### Run `npm install`

Running `npm install` will install all of the `node_module` dependencies required to start the project

### Run `npm start`

Running an `npm start` will begin your local application in a local server. This is your development environment. The server address is at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Project Structure

The /parti folder contains 2 folders (public & src), package.json, and a README.md

## /parti/public

This folder contains `index.html`. Because React is a One-Page web application, you won't be touching the `/parti/public` at all

## package.json

package.json is the project configuration. This is a list of all the `node_module` dependencies. Running an `npm install` will scan through your `package.json` and install all dependencies

## /part/src

The source folder is where you will be doing all of your work as a developer.
